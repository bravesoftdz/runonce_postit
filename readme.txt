RunOnce_PostIt allows your application to run only once.
If you try to run it again, you may post a message to the first running application.

RunOnce procedure is (a lot of) inspired by LSRunOnce of LazSolutions, created 
by Silvio Clecio :  http://silvioprog.com.br 

It works for lcl, fpGUI, msei and console applications.
